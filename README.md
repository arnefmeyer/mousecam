3D models and data extraction/analysis code for the head-mounted camera system described in:

>AF Meyer, J Poort, J O'Keefe, M Sahani, and JF Linden: _A head-mounted camera system integrates detailed behavioral monitoring with multichannel electrophysiology in freely moving mice_, Neuron, Volume 100, p46-60, 2018. [link (open access)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.09.020)

This repository contains the following:

* **mousecam**: a [Python package](https://github.com/arnefmeyer/mousecam/tree/master/mousecam) with functions for extracting and analyzing data recorded using the camera system, including
    - pupil fitting (including GUI)
    - body tracking (including GUI)
    - image registration (via fiji/imagej)
    - extraction of head orientation
* **parts**: [3D models](https://github.com/arnefmeyer/mousecam/tree/master/parts) (openscad/stl) and building instructions for the head-mounted camera system

## Software

### Head-mounted camera code

[Custom camera software](https://github.com/arnefmeyer/RPiCameraPlugin) for the Raspberry Pi (RPi), which also integrates with the open-ephys plugin-GUI. As this software uses [zeromq](http://zeromq.org/) (with [bindings](http://zeromq.org/bindings:_start) for many programming languages) for communication between the recording computer and the RPi, it can easily be extended/adapted to other systems.


### Measurement of head orientation/movement data

Code (including open-ephys plugin) for reading data from intertia measurement unit (IMU) sensors and synchronizing movement data with neural recordings is available [here](https://github.com/arnefmeyer/IMUReaderPlugin).


### Behavioral segmentation

A Python package for behavioral scoring (including GUI for manual annotation) can be found [here](https://github.com/arnefmeyer/BehavioralScoring).
